Multiple File Upload XBlock
==============================

This package provides an XBlock for use with the edX platform which provides a staff graded assignment with multiple 
file uploads. Students are invited to upload files which encapsulate their work on the assignment. Instructors are 
then able to download the files and enter grades for the assignment, as well as provided annoteded files for students.
